The extracted text from "Table 3" in the PDF document has been successfully obtained. Next, I'll parse this text to create a structured data frame. This involves identifying the headers, the models, 
and the performance metrics for each model under different conditions. Given the structure of the table and the complexity of the text layout, this step will focus on accurately capturing the necessary data to then manipulate and update the table accordingly.

# Extract text from the provided PDF file

pdf_text = extract_text(pdf_path)

# Find the specific section of the text related to Table 3 using regex
table_text = re.search(r"(Table 3: Non-iterative results on two monolingual datasets[\s\S]*?)(Table 4:|4\.1\.5  Implementation Details\.)", pdf_text, re.MULTILINE).group(1)

It seems there was an error in parsing the data, resulting in incorrect model names and data association. This indicates the pattern used for matching the data did not accurately capture the structure of the table as intended. 
I'll adjust the approach to correctly parse the table data, focusing on accurately extracting the model names and their corresponding metrics. Let's correct this and ensure the data is accurately represented.
'''

# Parsing the extracted text to create a structured DataFrame

# Define a pattern to match the models and their scores
pattern = re.compile(r"(\w+(?:\s\w+)*\*?)\s+"
                     r"(\.\d+)\s+(\.\d+)\s+(\.\d+)\s+"
                     r"(\.\d+)\s+(\.\d+)\s+(\.\d+)\s+"
                     r"(\.\d+)\s+(\.\d+)\s+(\.\d+)")

# Find all matches of the pattern in the table text
matches = pattern.findall(table_text)

# Define the column names for the DataFrame
columns = ["Model", "H@1_80%", "H@10_80%", "MRR_80%",
           "H@1_50%", "H@10_50%", "MRR_50%",
           "H@1_20%", "H@10_20%", "MRR_20%"]

# Create the DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(matches, columns=columns)

# Convert numerical columns to float
numeric_cols = df.columns[1:]
df[numeric_cols] = df[numeric_cols].astype(float)

# Display the DataFrame to verify its correctness
df.head()

'''
It seems my attempt to correct the parsing has not yielded the expected results, leading to an empty DataFrame. This indicates the adjusted approach still did not align with the structure of the text extracted from the PDF. 
Parsing complex tables directly from text extracted from PDFs can be challenging due to variations in formatting and the potential for misinterpretation of the layout.
'''


'''
Given this, I'll refine my strategy to more directly and manually map the models and their respective metrics based on the structure observed in the text. 
This manual approach involves explicitly defining the rows as seen in the table, considering the nuances of text extraction from PDFs.
Let's proceed with a more tailored approach to accurately capture and reconstruct the table data.

# Adjusting the parsing approach to correctly match model names and their scores

# Correcting the pattern to better match the actual structure of the table text
# Considering the structure might have been incorrectly interpreted due to newlines and spaces
# Adjusting the strategy to manually specify the models and parse the values

models = ["MMEA", "EVA*", "MSNEA*", "MCLEA*", "MEAformer", "w/ MERP"]
# Split the table text into lines for easier processing
lines = table_text.split("\n")

# Initialize an empty list to hold the parsed data
data = []

# Process each model
for model in models:
    # Initialize a list to hold the current row data
    row = [model]
    # Find the line that contains the current model
    for line in lines:
        if model in line:
            # Extract the numbers (metrics) from this line
            metrics = re.findall(r"\.\d+", line)
            if metrics:
                # There should be 9 metrics per model (3 conditions * 3 metrics)
                if len(metrics) == 9:
                    row.extend(metrics)
                    break
    # If the row contains the correct number of elements, add it to the data list
    if len(row) == 10:
        data.append(row)

# Recreate the DataFrame with the corrected data
df_corrected = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)

# Convert numerical columns to float
df_corrected[numeric_cols] = df_corrected[numeric_cols].astype(float)
